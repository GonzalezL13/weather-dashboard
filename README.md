This week's challenge was to create a weather dashboard using OpenWeather's APIs. 
The API's I used were to receive the city's current weather, the 5-day forecast and the UV index. 
The only thing the user needs to do is just input a city and the information will come up. 

The link to my github is : https://github.com/GonzalezL13/weather-dashboard.git

the link to my deployed app is : https://gonzalezl13.github.io/weather-dashboard/

Below are the acceptance criteria the challenged provided.

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city


They also provided a mock-up preview of how it supposed to look.
